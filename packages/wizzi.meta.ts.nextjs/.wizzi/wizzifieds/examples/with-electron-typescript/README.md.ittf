        + Electron with Typescript application example
    p 
        + This example show how you can use Next.js inside an Electron application to avoid a lot of configuration, use Next.js router as view and use server-render to speed up the initial render of the application. Both Next.js and Electron layers are written in TypeScript and compiled to JavaScript during the build process.

        code output: &#39;export&#39;
        + to pre-generate HTML static files and use them in your app instead of running an HTTP server.

        + Custom Routes Proxying Example
    p 
        + This example shows the most basic example using Next.js&#39; new custom routes feature to proxy requests to an upstream server. We have 3 pages:
        code pages/index.js
        + ,
        code pages/about.js
        + , and
        code pages/hello/[slug].js
        + . All of these pages will be matched against Next.js and any other path will be proxied to the upstream server.
    br 
    p 
        + This approach is very helpful when you are trying to incrementally migrate your application to Next.js but still need to fallback to an existing application. You can add pages to your Next.js application one-by-one and then for non-migrated pages Next.js can proxy to the existing application until they are able to be migrated.

            title
            + https://localhost:3000/
        + and then a non-Next.js page like
        a

            + http://localhost:3000/legacy-first.html

            title
            + http://localhost:3000/another-legacy.html
        + which will be proxied to the upstream server since it doesn&#39;t match any pages/assets in Next.js.

    p 
        + Deploy it to the cloud with
        a

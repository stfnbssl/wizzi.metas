        + This example shows how to integrate Zustand in Next.js.
    br 
    p 
        + Usually splitting your app state into
        code pages
        + feels natural but sometimes you&#39;ll want to have global state for your app. This is an example on how you can use Zustand that also works with Next.js&#39;s universal rendering approach.
    br 
    p 
        + In the first example we are going to display a digital clock that updates every second. The first render is happening in the server and then the browser will take over. To illustrate this, the server rendered clock will have a different background color (black) than the client one (grey).
    br 
    p 
        + To illustrate SSG, go to
        code /ssg
        + and to illustrate SSR go to
        code /
        + , those pages are using Next.js data fetching methods to get the date in the server and return it as props to the page, and then the browser will hydrate the store and continue updating the date.
    br 
    p 
        + The trick here for supporting universal Zustand is to separate the cases for the client and the server. When we are on the server we want to create a new store every time with the
        code initialZustandState
        + returned from the get
        escape 
        + Props methods.
    br 
    p 
        + All components have access to the Zustand store using
        code useStore()
        + returned
        code store.ts
        + file.

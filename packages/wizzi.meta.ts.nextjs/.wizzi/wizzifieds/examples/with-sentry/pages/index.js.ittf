                p 
                    + This example demonstrates how to record unhandled exceptions in your code&lf;      with Sentry. There are several test pages below that result in various&lf;      kinds of unhandled exceptions.
                p 
                    + It also demonstrates the performance monitoring the SDK is able to do:
                    ol 
                        li 
                            + A front-end transaction is recorded for each pageload or navigation.
                        li 
                            + A backend transaction is recorded for each API or page route. (Note&lf;          that currently only API routes are traced on Vercel.)
                        li 
                            + Errors which occur during transactions are linked to those&lf;          transactions in Sentry and can be found in the [trace&lf;          navigator](https://docs.sentry.io/product/sentry-basics/tracing/trace-view/).
                        li 
                            + Manual performance instrumentation is demonstrated in the final&lf;          example below (throwing an error from an event handler).

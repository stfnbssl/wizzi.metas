            + downloading the repository manually
        + .
    br 
    p 
        + To use a live Fauna database, create a database at
        a 
            href https://dashboard.fauna.com/
            title 
            + dashboard.fauna.com
        + and generate an admin token by going to the
        b 
            + Security
        + tab on the left and then click
        b 
            + New Key
        + . Give the new key a name and select the &#39;Admin&#39; Role. Copy the token since the setup script will ask for it. Do not use it in the frontend, it has superpowers which you don&#39;t want to give to your users.

        + Setting Up Your Schema
    p 
        + The Next.js and Fauna example includes a setup script (
        code npm run setup
        + ). After providing your admin token, the script will:
    br 
    ul 
        li 
            b 
                + Import your GraphQL schema:
            + Fauna automatically sets up collections and indexes to support your queries. You can view these in your

                + GraphQL
            + .
        li 
            b 
                + Create an index and function:
            + The script will create a GraphQL resolver that uses
            a 
                href https://docs.fauna.com/fauna/current/api/graphql/functions?lang=javascript
                title 
                + User-defined functions
            + based on a sorting index.
        li 
            b 
                + Create a scoped token:
            + This token is for use on the client side. The admin key can be used on the server side.
    br 
    p 
        + After the script completes, a
        code .env.local
        + 
        a 
            href https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables

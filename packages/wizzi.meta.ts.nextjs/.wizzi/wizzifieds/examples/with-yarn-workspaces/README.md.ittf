        + Yarn workspaces example
    p 
        + Workspaces are a new way to setup your package architecture thatâ€™s available by default starting from Yarn 1.0. It allows you to setup multiple packages in such a way that you only need to run yarn install once to install all of them in a single pass.
    br 
    p 
        + In this example we have three workspaces:
    br 
    ul 
        li 
            b 
                + web-app
            + : A Next.js app
        li 
            b 
                + foo
            + : A normal node module
        li 
            b 
                + bar
            + : A react component, that gets compiled by Next.js (see

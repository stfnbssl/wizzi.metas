                        + The Idea Behind This Example
                    p 
                        a 
                            @ href "https://www.apollographql.com/client/"
                            + Apollo
                        + is a GraphQL&lf;        client that allows you to easily query the exact data you need from a&lf;        GraphQL server. In addition to fetching and mutating data, Apollo&lf;        analyzes your queries and their results to construct a client-side cache&lf;        of your data, which is kept up to date as further queries and mutations&lf;        are run, fetching more results from the server.
                    p 
                        + In this simple example, we integrate Apollo seamlessly with
                        + {' '}
                        a 
                            @ href "https://github.com/vercel/next.js"
                            + Next
                        + by calling
                        + {' '}
                        a 
                            @ href "https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props"
                            + getStaticProps
                        + {' '}
                        + at our Page component. This approach lets us opt out of getInitialProps&lf;        and let us use all the niceties provided by
                        + {' '}
                        a 
                            @ href "https://github.com/vercel/next.js"
                            + Next
                        + .
                    p 
                        + On initial page load, while on the server and inside
                        + {' '}
                        a 
                            @ href "https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props"
                            + getStaticProps
                        + , we fetch the query used to get the list of posts. At the point in&lf;        which the query promise resolves, our Apollo Client store is completely&lf;        initialized. Then we serve the initial HTML with the fetched data and&lf;        hydrate Apollo in the browser.
                    p 
                        + This example relies on
                        a 
                            @ href "http://graph.cool"
                            + graph.cool
                        + for&lf;        its GraphQL backend.
